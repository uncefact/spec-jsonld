# UN/CEFACT vocab
The aim of this project is to expose the rich UN/CEFACT semantics so it can be used in conjuntion with modern linked data technologies to express precise, machine readable semantics. The intended audience of the UN/CEFACT vocab includes other UN/CEFACT projects as well as anyone else in the world expressing trade and transport data. 

UN/CEFACT vocab builds upon the work done on the RDM2API work stream between 2018 and 2021, resulting among other deliverables in a draft vocabulary: https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/. The primary goal for this project is to bring this to a stable v1.0 by Q3 2022, sorting out bugs and generating the necessary material to support it. 

## Contribution
We call upon everyone in the digital trade and transport space to participate and contribute. Especially we are looking for active users of Linked Data technologies to drive quality requirements. 

Note that you need to be a UN/CEFACT Delegate in order to formally contribute as Subject Matter Expert to this standard. Experts are expected to contribute to the work based solely on their expertise and to comply with the UN/CEFACT Code of Conduct and Ethics and the policy on Intellectual Property Rights.

[Add headline and UN logo on the html · Issue #123 · uncefact/spec-jsonld · GitHub](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/issues/123) - closing as work is done see https://dmvc7xzscpizo.cloudfront.net/classes as example which will automatically move to the agreed domain.

The following need some resolution due to configuration before we can close
https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/issues/114 - will resolve its self when the domain is not a temporary one.

Requires Coding changes and a PR to make the changes
[Move property descriptions to relationship · Issue #122 · uncefact/spec-jsonld · GitHub](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/issues/122)

One new thing came up recently, there are clashes between class and attribute names and only differentiator is the case.  An issue will be raised as this could cause confusion.  Example of `transportEvent` given, where `consignment` has been added as part of the name, if semantic we probably need to push back, issue created [Generic solution for property and class name collision · Issue #125 · uncefact/spec-jsonld · GitHub](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/issues/125)

The above needs to be done for `V1` 


## Discussions
Maintaining a connection to the CCL and RDM, some issues exist in the semantics for the CCL, a suggestion was made to depreciate the library where it’s not in BSP and support a submission into ISO for the BSP RDM.  The work that’s been done on the GitHub for the LD and vocab should be promoted to the community further.  Bureau call is 2nd October to discuss the above.  The project will publish the work based on the inputs that we have, if there are updates the latest spreadsheet should be provided to include new elements.

Where is the BSP RDM published to the world

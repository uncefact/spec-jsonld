Forum recap: Townplan

Bureau meeting. Project extension. 
In order to decide on extension duration, dedicating the meeting to parse through all issues, categorizing what we consider "mandatory for v1" issues. 

12 issued was tagged for v1. Two are done but open pending testing, so in reality 10. 
We need to account for long deployment period (1 month!). 

Decision to extend with 6 months - even if it should be possible to complete significantly faster. 
v1 MUST be ready for the next forum, we will not extend beyond Forum 39. This means unresolved issues will be left for a future post-v1 release.

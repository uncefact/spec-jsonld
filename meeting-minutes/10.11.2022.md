## Discussion

Our current version is ready to be published as `v1` however we acknowledged that its based upon a BSP export from `D20A` and should be updated, we have an open ticket for this (https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/issues/87) but despite several requests for either 
1. Updated BSP 
2. Draft of the output JSON Schema 

Neither are avaialbe to us to use currently, the excel was manually manipulated to export it, and no reply on the json schema front from project team, also chased with SP during this call its being finalised.  So we agreed that as we are we can only publish what we have (today) and improve from there.

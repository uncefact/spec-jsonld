## PR's

Looking at https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/pull/171 a big one to move from the original excel source over to the json schema, which allows us to plan exit from the project.

We can see changes have come from D22A and exampels were reviewed from code lists to show the outcome.  We also reviewed PR 5 from vocabulary-outputs, as well as https://github.com/uncefact/vocab-trade/pull/6

Good to Merge.

Ksenyia will build context, deploy to AWS and all is live, there is an issue with Ksenyia's machine which will mean a slight delay to make these changes.

## General

The old service url for the vocab will be shown as deprecated and direct to the current vocab url (hosted on AWS)
https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/ to https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/

Project can move to exit as deliverables met for the UNCEFACT project this will follow the usual process for this.

Remaining GitHub issues will continue to be resolved by community and are not part of the official project.

## Incorrectly subdivision of property classes
Fixed (not yet pushed to PR yet). 

## Process code lists (new Transformer-class) 
Issue: https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/issues/169
Blocked by https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/issues/3
Discussion about the challenges in switching to a new, immature export.  
Decision: we can't let ourselves be blocked by external dependencies, so we are moving along with generic `codeType` strings. 

## LOCODE anchors
Fixed

## Add search
https://github.com/uncefact/spec-jsonld/issues/150
Pending

## Deploy preview version of the HTML pages for review
